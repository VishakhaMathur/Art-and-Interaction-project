Answer the following:

- How would you would like viewers to perceive the major project theme in your work?
This artwork meets the theme of entangled reality by combining ideas of exploring space, fictional elements and user interaction. The artwork shows different realities and their connections or entanglement with each other. There are real world conditions like astronaut is surrounded by spaceship, moon, planet and a satellite in the space. As you further progress in the artwork, the astronaut reaches an imaginative planet, interacts with monsters, aliens, multiverse with different gravity and chaotic zone with giant space rocks. The astronaut can even goes back to the same planet and bring the aliens with him because environment in space is not safe for them. This almalgamation, and intertwining of reality and imgaination becomes a core idea of entangled reality. It shows how things are connected. There is a combination of multiple scenes and realities with integration of sound  creates a sense of exploration in the concept of entangled reality.

- How does interaction enhance the viewerâ€™s experience?
Everything is carried by the user- movement of astronaut or aliens through all the arrow keys, killing the monster, destroying the rocks by pressing the mouse on the shooter at the bottom, changing the position of the shooter by pressing 'r' and 't', launching the spaceship by pressing 's' or selecting the scenes(number) in the controller at the top, everything is controlled by the user. They can go to the next scene by moving the astronaut at the very right of the canvas or go the previous scene by moving the very left of the canvas. Scene four is the trap zone where they are so many rocks. You need to destroy the rocks in order to escape. These interactions make the users feel like they are the part of this theme. They trigger users to interact just the way taught in the lectures.
